# An app aimed to improve waste recycling
 - Imagine this situation, You go purchase something fom a supermarket, for example a drink. After doing away with the drink, you're left with an empty Can. There are different ways to do away with the can.
    - Some will use the can for some other purpose.
    - Some will dispose it by burning.
    - Some will dispose it by throwing it away.
  
 - Now picture this, the seller issues an option for recycling back the item. In the following ways, high priority products have the option of recycling during purchase.
      - Items marked as Recycle-able can be returned to the respective buyer for recycling.
      - Items not marked are recycled in the following way, the user can check in the app for collection centres where the can check if the centre collects the same type of waste.
  
## The advantage of using the app
- Whenever the user recycles something they earn coins, these coins are accumulated into their account. After enough accumulation these coins can be redeemed depending on the collection centre.
- Coins are buyer specific and the value of each recycled item is equivalent to a certain number of coins.
- Some companies advertise the recycle option on their products but the turn-out to this is strategy isn't always as expected. This app aims to accelerate this process by building the morale of users emphasizing the importance of recycling waste products and maintaining a clean environment.

# This idea is still initial and am planning to add improvemements later on.
